Groupwork
---------

Procedure:
1. Register your group on Moodle ("Making groups for group work 2"). Two members per group.
2. Download the pcap trace file corresponding to your group number from Teams.
   The file is in the directory "Project 2/traces". You can uncompress it with gunzip.
3. Take this text file and answer the questions below at the indicated places.
4. Upload your solution (i.e. this text file with your answers filled in)
   to Moodle ("Upload Group Work 2") by *one* member of your group by May 20.

The pcap file contains the network traffic of a small company network with a few
clients and servers. There are also hosts that access the company servers from
outside (i.e. the Internet). The company network has a /16 address.

Note that the pcap file does NOT contain useable packet payload and all IP addresses
have been randomly generated. You should therefore focus on the packet headers.
You are free to use whatever tool you like to analyze the pcap file. Wireshark
might be a good choice if you are not familar with command line tools like tcpdump.

Questions
===================================================================

0) What is your group number and what are the UCLouvain (!) email addresses of your group members?
   Group number: 44
   Group member e-mail 1: merlin.camberlin@student.uclouvain.be
   Group member e-mail 2: zoé.schoofs@student.uclouvain.be

a) What is the /16 address (e.g. 1.2.0.0) of the company network?
   Your answer: 117.223.0.0/16

b) There are 7 hosts in the company network. Write below their addresses
   and their function, for example "1.2.3.4   Mail server".
   Your answer:
      117.223.5.252:
		- Send DNS queries to 117.223.195.47 and to 117.223.69.180, 
		- Send TCP, HTTP messages to 117.223.199.251 	
      117.223.21.222
		- Send DNS queries to 117.223.69.180
		- Send TCP, HTTP messages to 191.217.248.98
      117.223.45.17 
		- Send TCP, HTTP messages to 
			- 97.160.250.32, 
			- 96.62.40.195, 
			- 96.183.202.21, 
			- 96.122.228.241,
			- ...
      	 DNS Server
      117.223.195.47 DNS Server:
			- Respond only to IP in the company network
      117.223.199.251 
		- Send TCP, HTTP messages to several IP in and outside the network

      117.223.202.141
		- Send


c) There are several hosts in the trace that try to attack the company.
   However, there are also two external hosts that access the company's
   servers in a (probably) legitimate way. Give the IP addresses of those
   two benign hosts.
   Your answer:
      ...
      ...

d) There are two network attacks in the trace. Give for the first attack the
   following information:

   1. Short attack description. Just one line like "SQL injection against
      database server" is enough, but don't be too generic (not just "injection").
   2. How many hosts participated in the attack
   3. Start time of the attack (in seconds since begin of trace)
   4. How many packets were exchanged in the attack (packets sent AND received).

e) Give the same information as in question d) for the second attack:
   ...

(The order of the attacks doesn't matter)
